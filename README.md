# UX Profile Page


Hi, I’m Maria. I’m a User Experience Researcher from Moscow. I currently work as a UX Researcher Consultant. Also, I start learning front end software engineer.

I started this [webpage](https://marypavlenko.github.io/UX-Profile/) as a place to document everything I learned while transitioning from User Experience Researcher to Developer.
